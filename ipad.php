	    <h4>iPad App - Proof of Concept</h4>
        <p>To take the Minnesota Solar Suitability App to the next level of functionality, a prototype iOS-
based application for iPad and iPhone has been developed. The hope is to make this app a free

download from the iTunes App Store so that solar installers and developers can use it to work

with customers to see if there is solar potential on their rooftop or property. The use of the app

could allow installers to conduct virtual site assessments without climbing on the customer’s

roof. The reports can also be customized with the company’s logo and contact information, and

reports can be saved to the device, printed, or emailed. Needs include finalizing user interface

and features, fine-tuning customizable fields, and providing ongoing support and maintenance.</p>
